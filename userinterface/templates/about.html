    <p id="txtAbout">
        The 2013 project: 3D nanoWebGIS interface and complex networks for molecular
        medicine data. The aim of WebValley 2013 is designing a novel web tool for
        studying change in cells (e.g. in morphogenesis or in disease) from different
        points of view and in interdisciplinary teams.<br/>
        We aim to extend the nanoWebGIS
        system for shared studies on bioimages with an interface for 3D spatial
        structure investigation and a whole new module for complex networks analysis.
        The project shall integrate mathematical and biological aspects, with the
        opportunity of working on original data from collaborating international labs.<br/>
        Technology will be the backbone of the project: the team will combine different
        open source software tools and propose new ways of interacting with data on
        non-standard devices such as smart TV displays.
